Git add

Git add -A (--all)

It will stage all modified deleted and deleted files in working directory 

It will add all files even if you are in directory up from home 

Git add -A my_dir/ 

This add the files under that directory but it will not do any changes to the top directory 

Git add -A is default action even if we remove -A

Git add --no-all my-dir/

This will add the file to stage and not make any changes on files which are removed

Git add -u (--update)

It adds all modified and deleted files but not untracked files, it does for entire tree 

Git add -u my_dir/

This will do the same on only my_dir directory 

Git add .

This will add the changes to staging area it looks similar like git add -A as long as you are in top directory 

Change directory and run below command 

Git add .

Add all the changes in current directory and subdirectory but not the top directory 

Git add -A will add all files in the complete working tree 

Git add *

This is not recommended because * is a shell command and it will not consider deleted files and .Git ignore files
